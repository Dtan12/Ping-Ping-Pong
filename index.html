  <!-- javascript libraries 
  p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and 
  inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source 
  because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

  Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas.
  You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

  <!-- p5.play.js is used to support SPRITES and GROUPS class code
  p5.play provides a Sprite class to manage visual objects in 2D space and features such as animation support, 
  basic collision detection and resolution, sprite grouping, helpers for mouse and keyboard interactions, and
  a virtual camera.
  The game running in the background was made with p5.play and it's about 100 lines of code. Check all the 
  examples/tutorials.
  p5.play extends p5.js, a javascript library (and a community) that aims to make coding accessible for artists,
  designers, educators, and beginners. If you are not familiar with p5.js, you should start here.

  p5.play is built for accessibility and simplicity, not performance. It is designed to be understood and possibly 
  modified by intermediate programmers. It is not a box2D-based physics engine, it doesn't use events, nor supports 
  3D. If you are looking for robust (but more complex) game frameworks I suggest phaser.io or easel.js.
